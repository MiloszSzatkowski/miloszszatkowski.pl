This repository holds the code for my website. I will propably use it for quick php snippets, but I hope it will be useful to someone else as well.

Worth checking are: page-projektowanie & page-sztuka as well as category.php.

For some of you who may wonder why this code contains different ways of dealing with problems I'll add that this wordpress theme was created on top of blankslate theme - http://tidythemes.com/ - which is an amazing starter theme. It comes with no styling and almost no custom php, but it has everything that is needed to run blog - no more, no less. I thought of developping child theme and abstracting almost anything to plugins, but I dropped this idea, because there's almost no Blankslate's code left in my theme.
